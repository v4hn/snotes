snotes - a simple notes system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
snotes is a flexible and easy to use notes system.


Requirements
------------
In order to use snotes, you need a working
git and [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) in your $PATH.

If you intend to use the SNOTES_CLEANUP option
to clean notes automatically, you also need perl around.
If you think this dependency is unnecessary, rewrite it
in sed / etc. and send it to me.

Installation
------------
Just run `make install`. The default installation prefix
is /usr/local. If you want to change that to /usr,
just run `make install PREFIX=/usr` instead.

Running snotes
--------------
Run snotes once to initialize its config and a notes
database for you. This also creates a first note called
'introduction to snotes'. Read it and prosper.
